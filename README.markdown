# GitPhone: An experimental iPhone app to stay connected with GitHub on the go.

## Project Information

I started this project to test out some ideas for an iPhone app which utilizes a 3rd party API.  Naturally, I chose GitHub because I'm an extreme fanboy.
It's not polished.  There are no tests.  It really doesn't do anything useful and I really don't where I want to take it.  However, there is a good deal
of infrastructure here that I feel is worth sharing, especially, since there are so few OSS iPhone apps out there in their entirety.

## Required frame-works

This project uses the [json-framwork](http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/) for easy json parsing.
Installation directions are [here](http://iphone.zcentric.com/2008/08/05/install-jsonframewor/).
